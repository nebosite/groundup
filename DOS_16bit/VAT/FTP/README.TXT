Vat 0.71 Pre-release

Sorry, but there is no documentation for this pre-release.  
Pretty much, the only API change is how I deal with WAV's and the new S3M
functions, so most of the old documentation is still valid.
If you poke around in VATDEMO.C and VAT.H, you should be able to figure 
most of the new stuff out.

The only other memory  models in real mode that I am supporting are 
medium and huge.  If you need a lib file for one of those models, 
send me a note.
