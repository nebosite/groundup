| PART II:  Mouse Functionality   |
|				  |
|---------------------------------|
					
Mouse functionality is pretty simple:

[ ] Left mouse button- draw on the screen using current brush and color
[ ] Right mouse button- picks up a color from the screen
[ ] Animated colors.  Drawing with one of the animated colors should leave
    behind an animated color trail.
[ ] Does the mouse track well?  Or does it seem sluggish?

|---------------------------------|
| 				  |
| PART IV:  User Friendly	  |
|				  |
|---------------------------------|

Flabbergasted is intended to have an exploration element, so some user
friendliness has been withheld to encourage experimentation.  

[ ] Was it easy to install?
[ ] Any problems getting it to run?
[ ] Are there any features or behaviors in flabbergasted that come off
 	more as annoying than tantalizing?


|---------------------------------|
| 				  |
| PART IV:  OS Friendly	  	  |
|				  |
|---------------------------------|
																						s70 Yell (stress mode)
Once all the functionality has been verified, we'd like to know that 
Flabbergasted doesn't do mean things to Windows 95.  Probably the best 
way to do that is put Flabbergasted in one of the stress modes 
(Ctrl-alt-pgup or ctrl-alt-pgdn) and let it run overnight.  

[ ] What OS are you running?
[ ] Run a stress mode for a length of time.  
	How long? 
	Any problems?
