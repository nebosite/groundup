/* Changes to VAT code made by Eric

- Changed compiler opts to /otrl /s to stop crashes.  (/oa was the culprit)
- Improved Freemidi function.  Added Freemidi use to loadMidi
- Expanded Maximum Midi tracks to 256.  Fixed a bug in the MIDI
	structure (had only 16 tracks hard coded)

- Changed some DWORDs in the CHANNEL struct to be LONGs so that negative
	compares could happen.
- Added a break; statement in command 20 in sdotick().
- Added code to help insure a period is generated  if the period is zero.
	This is near the beginning of the sdodiv() function.
- Changed loads3m() so that it allocates all the patterns before it reads
	them.  For some reason, greenmol.s3m crashes when loading if the patterns
	are allocated while they are being read.
- Added code to help catch divide by zero errors.
- Added debug lines.
- Added code to ignore pattern 0xfe.
- Added code to prevent invalid instruments and notes
- Fixed some slight problems with volume and tone slide in the s3m player.
- Added code to modplayer() so it doesn't mix channels with no smaple data.
- Improved the vibrato handler for mods

- Added some diagnostic printing things to mod.c
- Moved extern "C" wrapper to include structures in the header
- Added code to mod.c in dodiv() to screen out bad sample numbers
- Wavesetting does not need to clip values for the rate setting.
  All values are allowed now.
- Added LoadWaveFromMemory function
- Added dma_bufferlen and dma_buffer[] to header file
- Added longbuffer.  This is for collecting long streams of data.  This
  is hard to do outside of the mixer loop because the dma buffer is short
  and it is hard to prevent te interruption of data collection.
- Added code to LoadMod to bail on unknown module types.

- Added Gravis patch playing capability.
- Switched MIDI implementation away from FM to patches
- Added SaveWave() function
- Added GetMusicType() function


Notes:

Possible bug:  ticks are going by before dodiv ever gets called.
	Fix by initializing s3m_currenttick to 10000 in reset code.
